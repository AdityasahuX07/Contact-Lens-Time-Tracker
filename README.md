**👁️ What is Keratoconus ?**

Keratoconus is an eye disorder in which the cornea, the transparent front part of the eye, gradually thins and bulges outward into a cone shape. This causes distorted vision, including blurry vision, double vision, increased nearsightedness, irregular astigmatism, and light sensitivity, which can reduce quality of life. Both eyes are usually affected.
